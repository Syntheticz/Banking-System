Welcome to the Banking System project!

This project was developed as part of a college course, with the goal of creating a stable and functional banking system using the C programming language as a console application.

The banking system is a vital part of any economy, and our project aims to create a reliable platform for managing financial transactions. Whether you're a student learning about banking or a professional looking for a robust system, our project is here to help.

Our system includes features such as account management, transaction history, and secure authentication. We've worked hard to ensure that our system is user-friendly and intuitive, so you can easily manage your finances without any hassle.

As a console application written in C, our banking system is designed to be lightweight and efficient while providing all the necessary functionality. This approach allows us to create a stable and reliable system that can run on any platform without the need for complicated installation or setup.

To get started, simply download our source code and compile it on your system. Once compiled, you can run the application from the console and start managing your finances using our powerful banking features.
